## Dynatrace Environment

You must have access to a Dynatrace SaaS environment. [Sign up here](https://dt-url.net/trial){target="_blank"}

Save the Dynatrace environment ID and environment

* The ID is the first portion of the URL. (eg. `acb12345` from `https://abc12345.live.dynatrace.com`)
* Your environment is probably `live` but could also be `sprint` or `dev`

## Create API Token

!!! info "API Token Permissions"
    In this demo, you will only create an auto-tag rule,
    therefore the only permissions you require are `settings.read` and `settings.write`

    However, if you want to create additional configuration, your API tokens will differ and you may need an OAuth client.

    If you choose to extend this tutorial,
    refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs#example){target=_blank} to understand exactly which permissions you require.

In Dynatrace:

* Press `ctrl + k`. Search for `access tokens`.
* Create a new access token with the following permissions:
    * `settings.read`
    * `settings.write`
    * `metrics.ingest`

!!! info "Token used by Crossplane"
    Crossplane will use this API token to push and pull data
    from your Dynatrace environment.
